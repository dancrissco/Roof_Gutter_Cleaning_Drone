🔍 How It Works
1. Drone Flight
Takes off from the mower

Trims perimeter of the lawn

Returns and lands on the mower

2. Mower Motion
Drives around lawn perimeter

Begins full zig-zag mowing pass until entire lawn is covered

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3

PyBullet physics engine

URDF-based robot models

Procedural geometry for lawn, sidewalk, and hedges

🚧 Roadmap Ideas
 Add color-change or texture trail to show "mowed" regions

 Add obstacle detection or bumper sensors

 Convert mower to motor-actuated wheel control

 Mount a camera on the mower

 Use behavior trees (e.g., BehaviorTree.CPP + ROS 2)

 Generate logs or visual maps for coverage analysis

🧑‍🏫 Educational Use
This simulation is ideal for:

Robotics classes (multi-agent coordination, path planning)

AI + autonomy research demos

STEM demonstrations in schools or hackathons
